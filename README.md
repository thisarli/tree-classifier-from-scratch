# Intro Ml Cw1

To run the code, please follow the following steps:

- Open the project in a terminal
- pip install requirements.txt
- To run the evaluation (Task 3 and 4), run this command from the terminal: python -m script
- To visualise the trees, run this command from the terminal: python -m plotting

This runs the program on the clean dataset, as specified in line 6 (filepath) in the script.py file.
This will print all the required evaluation metrics to the terminal. 

To switch the dataset, change the filepath. 

Note, that running the ID3-Pruning on the noisy dataset can take around 3 hours.
