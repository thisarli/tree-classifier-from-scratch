# Intro Ml Cw1

GitLab repo for Introduction to ML CW 1

To get the code to run, please follow the following steps:

- Open the project in a terminal
- pip install requirements.txt
- Run the command: python -m script

This runs the program on the clean dataset, as specified in line 6 (filepath) in the script.py file.
This will print all the required evaluation metrics to the terminal. 

To switch the dataset, change the filepath. 

Note, that running the ID3-Pruning on the noisy dataset can take around 3 hours.
